This is old and may not work still. Hypem recently redesigned their website. Anyways here is out to install it

Install
=======

To install it extract the zip to a folder then go to tools>extensions and then click the developer mode dropdown.  Then hit "load unpacked extension" and point it to the extracted folder.  It should then just work.  It has a funny world with hello written on it icon, cause that was what they used in a tutorial.  The biggest bug I have found so far is if you have multiple instances of hypem open it gets confused.
