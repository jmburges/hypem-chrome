Install
=======

To install it go into developer mode (in extensionss), extract the zip to a folder then go to tools>extensions and then click the developer mode dropdown.  Then hit "load unpacked extension" and point it to the extracted folder.  It should then just work.  The biggest bug I have found so far is if you have multiple instances of hypem open it gets confused.

Usage
=====
Open up hypem and start playing something. Then click on the icon.  You should
be able to do pause the song, go to the next song and go to the previous song.

ToDo
====
  * Make it pretty (edit popup.html)
  * Refactor the check now playing stuff to be one function
