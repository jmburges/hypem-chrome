Install
=======

To install it extract the zip to a folder then go to tools>extensions and then click the developer mode dropdown.  Then hit "load unpacked extension" and point it to the extracted folder.  It should then just work.  It has a funny icon with hello written on it icon, cause that was what they used in a tutorial.  The biggest bug I have found so far is if you have multiple instances of hypem open it gets confused.

Usage
=====
Open up hypem and start playing something. Then click on the icon.  You should
be able to do pause the song, go to the next song and go to the previous song.
Currently loving songs doesn't work.

ToDo
====
  * Make sure it works
  * Create an Icon
  * Make it pretty (edit popup.html)
